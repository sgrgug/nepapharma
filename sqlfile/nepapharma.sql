But, this can be avoided if healthcare companies realize the importance of cybersecurity in healthcare industry before they fall victim to cyberattacks.The main reason healthcare companies are the biggest target of cyberattacks is because these companies hold sensitive data worth high monetary and intelligence value. This includes information such as bank and credit card details, patients protected health information, social security numbers, and much more.\r\n\r\nAll of this information can be worth millions of dollars. In fact, it has been reported that health records can be sold up to 10 times or more as compared to stolen credit card numbers on the dark web.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it has been reported that as compared to other industries, the cost to compensate for data breach in healthcare costs three times more.\r\n\r\nCybersecurity measures help against cyberattacks, security breaches, and information leak/theft. It can help save healthcare organizations huge amounts of money that they would otherwise need to pay in case the patient data gets leaked. If these organizations are not educated about the importance of cybersecurity in healthcare, then it’s not long before they fall victims to it.\r\n\r\nTop 5 tips on how to avoid cyber attacks in healthcare\r\nCyber-security issues in healthcare information can pose a serious threat to our organization. Therefore, it is important that you know how to protect your organization against cyber-attacks.\r\n\r\n1. Consider cloud solution for sensitive data \r\nWhen it comes to keeping your organization’s data and information secure, cloud solution is your best bet. Not only does it help protect your data, but also creates information backup that can be used in case of any security mishaps.\r\n\r\nToday, different industries, including healthcare, are uploading their sensitive data to Cloud to protect it from getting into the wrong hands.\r\n\r\nHowever, it has been reported that 25% healthcare organizations using the public cloud said that they are not encrypting patient data, which can result in cyberattacks.\r\n\r\nCybersecurity measures such as multi-factor authentication, data encryption ensuring security compliance, and incident response programs can help strengthen information security on cloud.\r\n\r\nThis is something that organizations really need to focus on.\r\n\r\n2. Perform risk assessment test \r\nAccording to a rule passed by HIPAA back in 2003, healthcare organizations were asked to take a risk assessment test to ensure the health and safety of workplaces.\r\n\r\nHowever, no penalty was imposed if the rule was not followed, therefore not many companies took the risk assessment test seriously.\r\n\r\nHowever, this changed in 2009, when the HITECH Act made it necessary for all healthcare organizations to perform security risk analysis.\r\n\r\nThis analysis is important as it helps point out problems in the security system of an organization, and helps identify threats beforehand, to avoid any potential problems in the future. It also helps evaluate the suitability and effectiveness of existing control measures.\r\n\r\nYou might also want to read: A GUIDE TO HIPAA COMPLIANT HEALTHCARE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n3. Make sure all software’s are up to date \r\nA lot of healthcare companies don’t take software updates seriously. Mainly because the majority of organizations are not aware of the significance of software updates, and how outdated softwares can increase the risk of cyber attacks on healthcare companies, giving attackers a backdoor into the rest of your systems.\r\n\r\nSoftware updates usually incorporate necessary upgrades for your system that can help protect your system from security attacks and threats.\r\n\r\nMajority of software updates include critical patches to security holes, which makes them extremely important for digital safety and cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nNot updating your system makes it vulnerable to security breaches which can cost companies millions of dollars in the long run.\r\n\r\n4. Employ cybersecurity specialists  \r\nSecurity breaches can wreak havoc on organizations, not only resulting in bankruptcies, but also putting them out of business for good.\r\n\r\nAccording to stats, in the past two years, around 89% of healthcare organizations experienced a data breach. Data breaches not only result in heavy fines, but also in loss of customer trust.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important for healthcare businesses to focus on the importance of internet security, and take all possible steps to protect patient data before your organization faces a similar mishap.\r\n\r\nOne effective way to protect your company against such unpleasant circumstances is hiring employees that work solely to keep your company’s digital security in check.\r\n\r\nYou might also want to educate the rest of your staff about the importance of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry, and hire security officials who ensure the implementation of HIPAA policies and norms.\r\n', ''),

With the right use and practices AI has the potential to change the whole landscape of the healthcare sector.\r\nLet\'s look at how AI is transforming the future of healthcare\r\nAccording to stats, the global AI market is anticipated to reach $267 billion by 2027. More than half of the businesses that have implemented AI have reported an improvement in productivity later on. \r\n\r\nThe impact of AI on industries is expected to bring forth a whole new era of progress and development in the future.\r\nUpcoming AI trends in the healthcare industry\r\nLet’s look at some of the AI trends in healthcare that are expected to grow in the next few years. \r\n\r\nMedical diagnostics \r\nAI can assist doctors in making accurate medical diagnosis for patients. Studies show that AI is as effective as human doctors in making medical diagnosis based on images and medical reports. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the complex algorithms of AI can detect whether a patient is suffering from a disease even before the symptoms appear, for example that of AI medical diagnosis apps.\r\n\r\nHealthcare companies are looking forward to further development in this field because not only is AI fast and accurate at specialty-level diagnostics, but it is also a cost-effective solution.\r\n\r\nDrug discovery \r\nDrug research and development is a lengthy and costly process. It takes years for researchers to discover, develop, test and bring a new drug to the market.\r\n\r\nRecently, a lot of health companies have started leveraging artificial intelligence to make the whole process less time-consuming and affordable.  \r\n\r\nArtificial intelligence in drug discovery has led to ease and success in many phases of the process such as chemical synthesis and poly pharmacology.\r\n\r\nWith further innovations on the way,  we can expect to see many applications of AI in drug discovery in the future.\r\n\r\nRobotic Surgeries \r\nThe use of robotics in the healthcare industry is growing. Medical surgeries are being revolutionized in terms of speed and safety with the help of AI and collaborative robots.\r\n\r\nDeep learning along with complex algorithms allow AI to study patterns within surgical procedures to enhance best practices and increase surgical robots’ control accuracy to submillimeter precision. \r\n\r\nAI machines are also able to study data and information collected from past surgeries to develop improved surgical methods. As AI becomes more sophisticated, we can expect a decrease in complications caused during surgeries.  \r\n\r\nVirtual nursing assistants  \r\nWith nurse workload and cost of labor rising rapidly, the majority of healthcare companies are turning to AI solutions.\r\n\r\nA virtual nursing assistant such as Care Angel, is an automated analytics and information system made to reduce unnecessary hospital visits for patients and lessen the burden on healthcare providers. \r\n\r\nVirtual healthcare assistants can work 24/7, examine patient symptoms, and provide quick solutions. According to research, virtual caregiver inventions can be successful tools for health interventions.\r\n\r\nA feasibility study conducted in 2015 indicated that 44% of patients that have interacted with a virtual nursing assistant would choose virtual nurse consultation over a human clinician.

It has been designed to support both iOS and Android, which makes it ideal for enterprise application development.\n\nAccording to Flutter’s official website: “It’s defined as Google’s UI toolkit for creating beautiful and natively compiled applications for mobile, desktop, and the web from a single codebase.”\n\nThe flutter framework is a relatively new and powerful development tool for cross-platform app development.\n\nFlutter has many benefits making it an excellent choice for app development, including its cross-platform capabilities, speed of execution, and ease of use.\n\nBenefits Of Using Flutter For Enterprise Application Development\n1. Ease of Use\nFlutter is designed to be easy for developers to understand and learn, making it a good option for new or inexperienced developers. It creates an environment where experienced programmers can quickly work together in teams without having to re-learn the basics each time they join a project. This helps keep costs down as well since there is no need for specialized resources when working with flutter!\n\n2. Speed\nWhen using the flutter framework, apps run faster than if developed through other frameworks because its reactive programming system reduces the number of operations needed by 60%. The benefits don’t stop at speed though, flutter is also designed with beautiful animations in mind that help make the user experience better.\n\n3. Smooth Transitions\nThere are many developers and companies who have found flutter to be a great tool for designing their apps as well as those of their customers. For this reason, flutter has become one of the fastest-growing frameworks on GitHub today! This means not only do you get all these benefits but there’s a whole community out there ready to work alongside you in your journey towards enterprise application development success!\n\n4. Easy Integration with IDEs\nFlutter integrates with existing tools like Android Studio or Xcode so it can function seamlessly when adding features from other programming languages into your project. It even offers plugging capabilities for third-party modules and APIs, so you’re not limited to flutter’s built-in features only.\n\n5. Native Look and Feel\nWhen using Flutter, the app will look like it was developed natively for the platform. This means there is no need to worry about clashing design or features as everything integrates seamlessly together. It also eliminates the need for a separate developer who only knows how to build apps in one specific environment – which saves time when fluttering around!\n\n6. Backed by Google\nIn this day and age, many people want assurances that they are investing their money in something from a company they can trust. With flutter backed by Google, companies know they’ll have an excellent tool at their disposal without having to deal with the uncertainty of other frameworks.\n!    \n7. Cross-Platform Projects\nFlutter is designed to work on a wide array of devices, which allows flutter developers to create cross-platform apps. This can be especially useful for enterprise application development in industries where there are different types of mobile devices in use. There’s no need to build two separate apps if you can just develop one app that will run seamlessly across platforms!\n\n8. Test-Driven Development\nBeing able to write tests alongside your code ensures quality, as well as help, prevent bugs from sneaking past security measures into production. Test-driven development also helps produce more stable software, because while it may take longer at first, testing reduces the risk of new features breaking anything else down the line.\n\n9. Better Separation of Concerns\nFlutter separates UI from the business logic so that developers can work on different parts without worrying about stepping over each other’s code. This means developing with flutter is a low-risk option for enterprises who want to have full control over their app while getting all these benefits as well – what more could you ask for?\n\n10. Faster Development \nFlutter has been found in many cases to be up to 30 times faster than the alternatives. This can have huge implications for enterprise application development, especially when you’re trying to meet deadlines or get new features out as quickly as possible – and it’s all thanks to Flutter’s development speed!\n\n11. Easy Debugging\nWhen flutter’s code breaks down, there are no long stack traces that will need decoding, like what would happen in other environments. Instead, developers get a detailed view of exactly where their program went wrong, without having any trouble finding the root cause because everything about flutter works seamlessly together. Not only does this save time, but means less stress for developers, too!\n\n12. Mobile-First Design\nThe mobile-first design ensures that your app can be accessed by users on any device, which helps maintain consistency across platforms. This is especially important in enterprise application development, where you may need to accommodate both desktop and mobile devices – the flutter framework makes it all possible!\n\n13. Open Source Development\nFlutter has an open-source license so the community will always have access to its engine, as well as a wide range of third-party modules and APIs. As long as flutter code meets Google’s quality requirements then everything will be approved even if it isn’t considered “official.” Developers also get full control over what their apps do because they’re not limited to flutter’s APIs, which makes flutter a great choice for enterprises.\n\n14. Create Beautiful Apps \nFlutter is designed to make app development easier and more beautiful, so users can enjoy an aesthetically pleasing experience no matter what device they’re using. No other framework out there provides these benefits in such depth—only flutter', ''),

You might have made up your mind to specialize in a specific field within the software industry and are keen on pursuing it. However, rapid advances in technology might make you realize that opting for one particular field can limit the kind of work you can do in the future. Today, we will be discussing the potential career paths you can choose as a software engineer to secure your present and future.\r\n\r\nWhat are the main fields of Software Development?\r\nTo assist you in finding the right software development career, we will be covering some of the best software engineering fields. Here are a few of them.\r\n\r\nBackend Web Development\r\nMost computer science graduates or self-taught programmers, mostly start off their careers learning Java or C++ and this lands them a standard role, let’s say, as a back-end web engineer. \r\n\r\nWhile that’s a good start, limiting yourself to only Java or C will restrict the work you can do later on and you will be competing with a few Java-based back-end development jobs. That fact is that many successful tech companies today, such as; YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, and Uber don’t really count on Java anymore and instead use Python or PHP to handle the backend.\r\n\r\nWhat you really need to do here is to pick up languages like Python or PHP while you are learning Java. This will make you a stronger candidate and more attractive when it comes to landing a job.\r\n\r\nFront-end Web Development\r\nAnother popular software development career is front-end development. It is a comparatively easy place to start if your goal is just to get a job. You choose some frontend web development technologies such as JS, CSS, or HTML and also learn a few frameworks like Angular or React and that will be enough to help you become a front-end developer.\r\n\r\nFull-stack Development\r\nNow, if you want to sharpen your skill set and become more desirable as a developer, you might want to learn both frontend and backend development. That will make you a full-stack developer and this will benefit you in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe reason why full-stack development is beneficial because websites are here to stay. As smartphones become more powerful, companies are investing more time and money into making the web more responsive, instead of developing native mobile apps and Progressive Web Apps are a perfect example of this.\r\n\r\nChoosing a software development career as a full-stack developer is also quite an entrepreneurial step. If you know how to develop both the frontend and backend aspects of the web, you can pretty much launch your company and turn your skill into a long-term business.\r\n\r\nRead More: WHY I SHOULD AND SHOULDN’T USE OFF-THE-SHELF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS?\r\n\r\nMobile App Development\r\nThis one is big and one of the most popular and highest-paying software development careers. Many programmers have built their careers entirely around iOS & Android application development.\r\n\r\nIf you are an expert iOS developer but choose to master the art of building Android apps too, that’s all you need to become a mobile app developer. It is in demand and it pays well too. \r\n\r\nAll you need to know is Kotlin or Java for Android app development and Swift or Objective C for iOS. As previously mentioned, knowing all the aspects of a specific field means you don’t have to work 9 to 5 with someone. Instead, you can run your own business. With a skill like this, you can even develop your own app. So if you are thinking long-term, that is a good plan.\r\n\r\nThese aren’t the only software development careers but knowing these will help you get a strong understanding of the software industry. Once you start growing, you can choose more roles for yourself. Here are some other choices:\r\n\r\nGame developer.\r\nGraphic designer.\r\nData scientist.\r\nBigData development.\r\nDevOps development.\r\nLearning these technologies, however, is one thing, and implementing them is a different story.

(6, 'The Ultimate Guide to eCommerce SEO ', '2022-06-28 14:49:26', 'What is the right way to go about search engine optimization? Why is SEO important for ecommerce? Where should you invest your time, money, and efforts to improve your website’s ranking? If you are searching for the answers to these questions then you’ve landed on the right page. In this eCommerce SEO guide, we are going to discuss everything you need to know regarding SEO best practices for ecommerce sites.\r\n\r\nRead down below to find out all about it.\r\n\r\nWhy Is SEO Important for Your eCommerce Site?\r\nRegardless of how amazing your website is, it is pretty much useless if it’s not appearing in Google’s search results. According to stats, the top five organic results on Google search alone, account for 67.60% of all the clicks. So, if you want your ecommerce website to be a success – SEO is your best friend.\r\n\r\nYour website needs to rank higher in the search results to derive traffic. Your ideal goal should be to rank on the first page of search results, since that’s where most of the action happens. By putting in effort and time into your SEO strategy, you can improve your website’s ranking, get more organic traffic, and increase your sales.\r\n\r\nSince you will already be getting plenty of traffic through SEO optimization, you would not need to invest money in product advertisements. Effective optimization can help your business get found easily by the target audience as they’re actively searching for products related to your service.\r\n\r\nEcommerce SEO step by step guide\r\nIn this eCommerce SEO guide, we will discuss all the important aspects you need to take care of while optimizing your ecommerce store. Let’s get into it.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Keyword research\r\nWhen someone thinks of SEO optimization, the first thing that comes to mind is “keywords.” \r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind is that ecommerce keywords are different from the usual keywords. This is because customers use product-focused keywords when it comes to online shopping.\r\n\r\nSo, these are the ones that you are going to target. You can conduct keyword research to see which terms customers are actively searching for.\r\n\r\nAlso, try to use the keywords that are relevant to your brand, have a high to medium search volume, and are easy to rank for. It’s always better to choose transactional keywords over informational  as their conversion rates are usually higher.\r\n\r\nHow do you find the right keywords?\r\nTo find the right keywords for your products, you need to think like a customer. What would you search if you were to buy a particular product? You can also ask your friends and family what their general search terms would be.\r\n\r\nMoreover, you don’t want to ignore competitor analysis. Make a list of your competitors, visit their website, and check the keywords they are ranking for. This would help you get a better idea about what’s going on in the market and would help you improve your overall SEO strategy as well.\r\n\r\nKeyword tools can be of great help for finding keywords. Though there are many free SEO keyword analysis tools that can be used, paid ones such as SEMRUSH and Raven Tools provide much more effective results as compared to free ones.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure to choose keywords that are relevant to your  products. This one important pointer is often ignored by ecommerce businesses. \r\n\r\nYou might also want to read: 5 Ecommerce trends you need to know for 2021\r\n\r\nStep 2: Site Structure for Ecommerce\r\nOther than keywords, the way you structure your website also impacts its user experience and ecommerce website ranking. There are two important rules that you should follow for the best ecommerce website structure.\r\n\r\nRule#1: It should be simple \r\n\r\nRule#2: All of your pages should be no more than three clicks from your homepage.\r\n\r\nWebsites that are over-cluttered are difficult to use. Therefore, you want to structure your site in the simplest way possible. Your customer should not have to spend too much time finding the product of their choice. Why? Because if they can’t quickly and easily find the product they are looking for – they’d switch to one of your competitors.\r\n\r\nEnsure that your ecommerce site architecture is scalable so you don’t have to rearrange it each time you include a new product category. Also, keep your product pages as close to the homepage as possible for better page authority.\r\n\r\nStep 3: On-page SEO for ecommerce website\r\nOnce your keyword research and website structure strategy are set, start focusing on on-page SEO. On-page SEO refers to everything that can be done on the website itself to improve its ranking. Good on-page SEO can help you increase the quality and quantity of traffic to your website, resulting in more leads and conversions.\r\n\r\nRecommended: REACT SEO BEST PRACTICES: TIPS & TECHNIQUES\r\n\r\nSo, how exactly does on-page SEO work? There are various factors to  consider. Let’s have a look at some of the important ones\r\n\r\n1. Choose the right URLs.\r\nOne common element that is often overlooked when it comes to website development is choosing the right URL. Here are some things to consider while choosing a URL according to SEO best practices for ecommerce sites.\r\n\r\nKeep it as short as possible—the ideal one is below 50-60 characters\r\nIt shouldn’t be too complex to understand\r\nUse hyphens to separate words\r\nUse keywords from your page title in the URL\r\nAvoid keyword stuffing as it can make your website appear spammy\r\n2. Include optimized content and product descriptions\r\nThe content on your website helps Google decide how the keywords are going to be ranked. If your website only has a bunch of  descriptions, with some keywords and nothing more, then there won’t be enough content on your website for Google to give it a good ranking position.\r\n\r\nTo ensure there’s enough content on your website include product descriptions and information about your services. You can also include a blog related to your services. This will not only help you build a good brand reputation, but will also improve your overall SEO strategy.\r\n\r\n3. Optimize Your Title Tags\r\nTitle tags (HTML tags) present at the top of every webpage can also be used to enhance your website’s SEO impression. This is because the title tags are mentioned prominently on the search results pages.\r\n\r\nAn SEO-friendly title tag is usually 50-60 characters long and includes relevant keywords. Poorly written, copied, and missing title tags should be avoided at all costs. \r\n\r\n4. Optimize Your Images\r\nThe next step in our ecommerce SEO guide is image optimization. Considering how important image optimization is for ecommerce website ranking, it’s a surprise that it’s often overlooked by many businesses.\r\n\r\nSo, why exactly is it important? Because it affects the website’s page load speed. \r\n\r\nWebsites with slow loading times usually have higher bounce rates. This is because customers don’t like to wait. If your website is taking too much time, they’ll probably switch to another one.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that your website’s images don’t impact its load speed negatively, try compressing images to minimize file size. There are several free platforms online to compress images. The ideal image size is between 1 to 2 MB.\r\n\r\nAccording to Anna Crowe from Search Engine Journal “The slower your sites load, the more visitors and revenue you’ll lose out on. Faster loading pages lead to a better overall website experience, hence Google’s move toward making it a mobile ranking factor.”\r\n\r\n5. Include an effective Meta descriptions\r\nWhen it comes to on-page SEO for ecommerce websites, meta descriptions can make all the difference.\r\n\r\nA meta description is usually a paragraph that mentions the summary of a webpage and its content within 150-160 characters. \r\n\r\nAn ideal meta description contains target keywords, is concise and to-the-point. It is displayed in the SERPs underneath the title of the page and is very important in gaining user click-through from it.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Link Building for eCommerce Sites\r\nLink building is another important factor that is crucial to ecommerce search engine optimization. In fact, it is said to be one of the top three ranking factors for Google. Hence, this is something that should be on your priority list while optimizing your website.\r\n\r\n1. Try to earn high-quality inbound links only\r\nTry to only target and allow quality inbound links to your website. This is because low-quality inbound links from low-authority websites won’t help your business in any way. Since high-quality links are usually from high-domain-authority websites, they prove to be very beneficial for your website.\r\n\r\nA low-quality inbound link can be easily detected through its appearance itself. These links tend to be stuffed with keywords filled with ads, and are written poorly. You can also use online tools such as Moz’s toolbar to check out the authority level of different domains.\r\n\r\nAccording to Brian Sutter from Forbes.com, “Sadly, much of the content being published is simply not worth linking to. 75% of it is getting zero inbound links. So forget the ‘more is better’ approach to content if you want links. Go with quality instead. Your content will generate links only if it is truly exceptional—’remarkable,’ as Seth Godin would say.”\r\n\r\n2. Identify broken links to your webpages\r\nBroken links to your web pages can have a negative impression on your overall website. There are many online tools, such as SEMrush Backlink Audit Tool, that can help you find and reclaim broken backlinks.\r\n\r\n3. Get links from your suppliers \r\nOne good strategy to get authoritative backlinks is to reach out to your suppliers or distributors. If you are running an online ecommerce business, get in touch with the supplier that makes lists for informing customers where to purchase products and ask them to include yours as well.', ''),

A kind of “startup for sale”. One of my acquaintances said, bluntly: “I am working to sell my startup for one hundred million dollars. Of these, about thirty million will be mine. This will be enough for a normal life, investments, and I will also help the children get back on their feet. ” And there are a lot of such people.\r\n\r\nBut selling your startup is not easy. You need to find an interested buyer, prepare documents, reports, and create a strong team that, even without the personal participation of the founder, can keep the startup afloat.\r\n\r\n3 scenarios for selling your startup Idea\r\n\r\nHowever, we decided to approach the coverage of the topic more globally and tell you about three scenarios of selling your startup at once.\r\n\r\nSell ??a startup idea with no visible profits or results.\r\nSell ??a startup that has risen and knows how to make money.\r\nSelling a startup as an investment: what to do to build relationships with a potential investor.\r\nImmediately, we note that each of the possible scenarios implies a lot and painstaking work, which will take a lot of time from the head of the startup. You need to be prepared for this, as well as for the fact that from time to time, unpleasant questions will be asked and people will refuse to accept the pitch, and someone will not pick up the phone at all.\r\n\r\nSelling an idea\r\nToday, almost no one is ready to invest in an illusory project, the development of which stopped at the stage of “creating a new social network of the future.” Representatives of various venture funds and start-up accelerators have pointed out more than once: everyone has a lot of ideas, we want to see a real project in which money can be invested. In fact, this is a reality from which you cannot run.\r\n\r\nEven the most ingenious idea cannot be simply presented as one sentence in six words. It should be a project, prototype, or business plan, even if in the simplest form. For example, the idea of ??” doing a workout in 7 minutes” is nothing special. It is a kind of idea that has already acquired a shell, but it is still far from the final product. But after the corresponding site appeared on the Internet with a set of simple applications, and timers, the developers got rich on downloading paid applications to mobile devices.\r\n\r\nSuch an idea can already be sold to an interested large company or to people who are ready to take on its implementation. It will be difficult to get a million, but you can agree on a percentage of income if it is successfully implemented. Ideas and prototypes work great on platforms like Kickstarter. Most of these are at the prototype stage, which is why the delivery time often stretches for months, and sometimes even a year. This is excellent, and most importantly, a very real way to sell your idea to the public and evaluate its reaction.\r\n\r\nAnd you need to come to terms with the fact that no one wants to buy just ideas today. People want to see what they are investing in.\r\n\r\nSelling a full-fledged startup with a team and a monetization plan\r\nDespite the active creation of startups in the United States, 8 out of 10 people do not want to take the place of the CEO of even a small chain of stores, let alone a startup. It’s all about the load and constant stress when the weekend disappears from the plans for many years. In this regard, many startups are working to grow the project to a large size, make money on the sale and work as a hired employee, or completely withdraw from the project.\r\n\r\nThere are some general rules to help you sell your startup.\r\n\r\nInform about the sale in advance\r\nMost likely, no one will knock on the door the day after the information about the sale of the startup appears. The market needs to be prepared for this by informing in advance about the intention to sell your product. Experts advise informing about the intention to sell the company 6-12 months before the start of the actual sale. This will allow you to achieve several goals at once: 1) potential buyers take up the study of the prospects for the acquisition; 2) expand information on the market, increase the customer base; 3) build up the hype and drive up the price.\r\n\r\nAlso, time is needed to prepare all documentation for the company. It is necessary to prepare a team, prioritize sales and inspire everyone with the desire to work even more actively this year, promising bonuses in case of a successful sale. A properly charged team is one of the factors that potential buyers will pay attention to.\r\n\r\nRecommend: WHY STARTUPS FAIL: TOP 5 REASONS\r\n\r\nWork with clients yourself \r\nThere are times when companies themselves are fighting for your business. For example, as in the case of WhatsApp (Google offered $10 billion, Facebook – twice as much). But more often, it happens that the owner of a startup cannot boast of having a unique technology or incredible performance. In this case, experts advise personally engaging in the sale. To do this, you need to compile a list of potentially interested companies, funds, investors and ask for personal meetings. During personal contact, it is necessary to demonstrate the main indicators of the startup, and talk about the prospects. If the startup is not a failure, investors will be found quickly.\r\n\r\nPrepare a realistic price\r\nBuyers will obviously ask about the price, after which they will start bargaining and knocking out discounts. In this case, experts advise preparing your own formula for the withdrawal of the company’s value or take an existing one. Asking for a certain amount for no known reason is a bad sign and an incentive for the buyer to knock out discounts.\r\n\r\nA startup founder is not a whole startup\r\nYou can’t think only about yourself and about the amount that will be used to replenish your bank account after the completion of the transaction. A startup is people who helped a common idea to come true. Lawyers who usually deal with start-up purchases advice writing everything possible in the sale contract: continuing the work of current employees in their places, keeping wages, responsibilities, the possibility of buying options, office space, privileges for employees. After signing the contract, there will be no opportunity to influence this.\r\n\r\nDon’t forget your startup \r\nIn an effort to sell your startup, you can forget that you cannot freeze its activities. As before, you need to monitor it, develop it and do everything by the business plan that you show potential buyers. Even after you shake hands, you still need time to complete all the documents. This can take months. For example, Microsoft’s takeover deal for Nokia (yes, we know that these are not startups, but still) has been considered for almost seven months. All this time, the startup has to work, find new clients, pay salaries and think about growth. \r\n\r\n“Selling a startup” as attracting investment\r\nYou can also “sell” a startup in the sense of attracting additional investments for your project. Money is needed for additional development, marketing, growth, and a host of other reasons. All this must be explained to the investor and the idea must be correctly conveyed to him: a million dollars is needed not for a new Audi, but for developing a startup. There are two scenarios here.\r\n\r\nThe first is the line of those wishing to invest money. Such a situation is possible when the startup is really good and has managed to sell itself to the market even before the moment when it really needed the money. A striking example is the American startup Uber, which has managed to attract more than $3 billion in investments, and the flow of people willing to give money does not dry out.\r\n\r\nThe second is when there are no investors. This scenario often applies to small startups that have not had time to show themselves. In this case, the same approach is applied when selling a company: you need to draw up a list of potential investors and seek a meeting with them. It is often difficult to get an audience directly, so you can ask someone to introduce you to each other, for example, those who have previously attracted investments from this fund. Various conferences and meetings are held from time to time.\r\n\r\nWhy you shouldn’t be afraid to contact funds or investment companies directly\r\nA doctor’s job is to heal people. The driver’s job is to drive vehicles. The job of a lawyer is to resolve legal issues. The job of investment fund employees is searching for and investing in startups and companies.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the main task of the fund is precisely to find new, interesting projects to invest money in or buy them for subsequent sale from other companies. But no matter how many employees the foundation hires, it is difficult for them to keep track of everything. Therefore, they are ready to accept and listen to every potential client.\r\n\r\nBut you need to come not empty-handed, but with a finished project. Talk about the current state of affairs, potential team, ideas for monetization. And then there is every chance of getting into candidates for investment or business sale.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking to develop and build an MVP for attracting investments, contact InvoZone today. We have already helped startups that are sold for millions of dollars (Meridio sold to Consensys) and those which acquired a handsome amount of money in investment (Stakester raised $2 million).\r\n\r\n ', ''),
(8, '3 Basic Software Development Models: Which One to Choose?', '2022-06-29 04:54:30', 'The importance of softwares in our lives can’t be underestimated. Regardless of whether you’re using a computer or mobile, following the GPS in your car, or playing a game on your Playstation, all of these tasks depend on the software of your device. Software development process involves the employment of different systems, known as software development models.\n\nToday we will be talking about top 3 software development models, which are:\n\nWaterfall\nAgile\nIterative and increment\nEach model comes with its own characteristics and features. However, the main purpose of all three models is the same – organizing project management, allowing software developers to design robust software.\n\nTop 3 software development models\nRead down below to find out which sdlc model is best for developing software.\n\n1. Waterfall Model\nThe waterfall model is one of the oldest software development models. Though this model was the most popular ones a few years back, its use has subsided over time as new and better software models have been introduced. However, since all other models are based on the classical waterfall model, its significance can not be ignored. \n\nThe waterfall model basically categorizes software development into linear sequential phases. In order to move on to the next phase, it is important that the previous phase is completed. This is because the outcome of the first phase is needed to begin the next phase. Hence, it’s name waterfall.\n\nThe different subsequent phases of the waterfall model are:\n\nFeasibility study\nRequirement analysis and specification\nDesign\nCoding and unit testing\nIntegration and system testing\nMaintenance\nAdvantages of Classical Waterfall Model\nIt is fairly easy to understand this model\nIts approach is highly methodical\nIt is a good choice for smaller projects\nDisadvantages of Classical Waterfall Model\nIt is not flexible\n2. Agile Software Development\nThough relatively new, the Agile development process model is currently being used by a huge number of IT companies. In fact, the model is so much preferred by some businesses, that they have even started using it for their non-tech projects.\n\nThis model allows software developers to find and repair small problems that can arise during the software development process. This helps stop them from transforming into larger issues later on. Under this model, the cycle releases are continuous, where minor additional alterations from the previous cycle are applied. Every iteration involves product testing. \n\nRead more: RESTAURANT APP DEVELOPMENT: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nThe different phases of agile software development model are:\n\nConcept\nInception\nConstruction\nRelease\nProduction\nRetirement\nAdvantages of Agile Model\nIt is flexible\nTesters, developers, and customers are in contact with each other continuously \nAs compared to other models, the end product of agile development is more robust and effective\nDisadvantages of Agile Model\nNecessary documentation and designing lacks emphasis.\nYou might also want to read: HOW TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL SOFTWARE SYSTEM USING MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE\n\n3. Iterative and Incremental Method\nThe interactive and incremental model is built on repetitions. This model does not require a full set of requirements to be started. In fact, the development usually starts with specifying and implementing just part of the software which can be tested and evaluated later on.\n\nA new version of the software is produced with each phase. Before finalizing  the product, there is a lot of reviewing and repeating involved.\n\nThe different phases of iterative software development model are:\n\n Planning\nAnalysis\nImplementation\nTesting\nEvaluation\nAdvantages of Iterative model\nDuring iteration risks can be identified and resolved\nProgress can be measured easily\n Disadvantages of Iterative model\nNot the best option for small projects\nWhat software development model is best for building complex programs or software?\nThe type of software development model that would work best for building complex software depends upon the type of project that is being developed, the expertise of the team working on the project, and the deadlines. Wondering how to choose sdlc model for a project?\n\nYou might want to use Waterfall software development model if:\n\nTiming and planning are an issue.\nIf the features and requirements for your project are well-defined and cant be altered.\nIf the product owner is not willing to be very hands-on.\nYou might want to use Agile software development model if:\n\nIf your project can be divided into modular tasks\nIf there are no well defined features or vision to your project, or if there’s a possibility of the requirements being altered later on.\nIf you want the development process to be flexible.\nYou might want to use Iterative model if:\n\nThe requirements are easy to understand and defined clearly\n When there’s a possibility that the requirements might change later on\nYou have to deliver a large project in a short period of time\nRead More About: Comprehensive guide to build custom retail software \nConclusion\nRegardless of whether the project development process is simple or complex, the best software development methodology for a project depends upon the project’s requirements.

Since both user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are usually mentioned together (as UI/UX), people tend to think that the term is referring to the same thing. \r\n\r\nHowever, user interface and user experience are like two different sides of the same coin. Both are connected in the sense that they make up a website, but differ when it comes to their characteristics. \r\n\r\nToday, we will be looking at what differentiates both. Read down for user experience and user interface design guidelines. \r\n\r\nWhat’s the Difference Between UI and UX? \r\nAccording to Rahul Varshney, co-creator of Foster.fm: “User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto canvas without thought; while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper match on it. A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the product’s success.” \r\n\r\nuser-interface-design-guidelines\r\n\r\nA user experience designer aims to understand the customers journey, which includes understanding customers, target audience, aspects of branding, conducting user testing, defining user flow etc. \r\n\r\nWhereas the role of a user interface designer is to focus on the logos, design, typography, color theme, and the visual design of a website. \r\n\r\nRead down below for more clarity.\r\n\r\nRecommended: IMPORTANT STEPS IN A USER CENTERED PRODUCT DESIGN PROCESS\r\n\r\nWhat is User interface design?\r\nUI or User Interface design development is the process of improving user’s interaction with a website or application, making it as easy to use and effective as possible. User interface development focuses primarily on the look and design of the websites and web applications \r\n\r\nThe elements of a website such as menus, icons, buttons and pages and all other visual elements contribute to the user UI of that website. In short, the main goal of a UI developer is to create a convenient interface, that fulfill the user’s needs. \r\n\r\nuser-interface-design-guidelines \r\n\r\n“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works” –SteveJobs \r\n\r\nEssential properties of well-designed UI \r\nYou can find a lot of information on the internet regarding different design patterns and techniques that can be used to craft websites and apps.\r\n\r\nFollowing guidelines from experts can be very helpful in creating  a good user-interface – but what exactly does a good UI design refer to? Let’s have a look at some of the main principles of an effective user-interface. \r\n\r\nUI-designer\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Clarity \r\nWhere do I find the main menu? If you’ve ever asked this question to yourself upon visiting a website, you’ve probably had to deal with a user interface that was poorly designed. \r\n\r\nIf people don’t understand how your website works or how to find the particular product/service they are looking for, they are likely to get frustrated and switch to another website that provides a better user-interface. \r\n\r\nAn ideal website design is the one that allows users to navigate easily and smoothly. The elements of the website I.e., icons, menus, search bars, buttons, etc. should be laid out neatly, so they don’t cause any user disruption. The quicker the visitor can get his task done on your website, the happier he is going to be with your service. \r\n\r\n2. Familiarity \r\nA lot of designer’s design with the goal of making the interface of the website/app ‘intuitive.’ But what exactly is an intuitive design? As far as web/app design is concerned, an intuitive design is the one that can be comprehended and understood instinctively.\r\n\r\nSo, how do you make your website design intuitive? By making it familiar! \r\n\r\nIn simple words, when a user opens your website, he/she should not require guidance on what to do next. For this, it is important that you integrate elements that are familiar to your users. \r\n\r\nRecommended: UI VS UX DESIGN – A QUICK COMPARISON\r\n\r\n3. Attractiveness \r\nAn attractive user-interface is more important than what most people think. Think about it yourself, would you rather enjoy surfing a website that’s plain and boring, or the one that’s enjoyable and appealing to the eye? Probably the second.  \r\n\r\nTrue, this might not be a 100% necessary thing when it comes to UX development, but it can make a lot of difference to the way your customers perceive your brand.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean one should load their website with superfluous eye-candy, but to merely polish their interface to make the experience remember able for the visitor. \r\n\r\n4. Maintainability \r\nA good user experience design should offer the flexibility of conveniently making changes to the design when needed, without causing a conflict of interest. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if you need to make alternations to the software, or include an additional feature, the process should be straightforward and easy. It should not compromise other features or cause flaws in the overall design itself. \r\n\r\nYou might also want to read: THE IMPORTANCE OF USER INTERFACE DESIGN IN MOBILE APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nWhat is User experience design?\r\nUX or User Experience development is the process of making a website more engaging, interactive and useful. In simple words, it is the procedure of developing and improving the quality of experience of users when they visit a website or application. \r\n\r\nUnlike UI development, UX development does not focus on the visuals; instead, it aims to improve the overall feel of the experience. It focuses primarily on wireframing a website, and structuring all its elements and components appropriately to create the user flow. \r\n\r\nuser-interface-design-guidelines \r\nVital Elements of Good User Experience \r\nAccording to stats, more than 65% of people prefer to read a UX-optimized site over a plain webpage. The UX design is one of the main factors that sets your website apart from the competitors. Let’s have a look at some of the essential elements of a good user-interface. \r\n\r\nUX-designer\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Accessibility \r\nAn effective website is the one that is accessible to everyone including the elderly, blind and disabled. There are a lot of features that can make your website user-friendly for disabled and blind people.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can include a text-to-speech feature for people who can’t see the content of your website. \r\n\r\n2. Mobile Compatibility \r\nThe number of mobile users around the globe is constantly increasing. Nowadays, users prefer to access websites through their phones rather than laptops. Hence, mobile optimization holds a lot of importance for user experience. \r\n\r\nThe mobile app design of your website should be clean and understandable, and should have a quick page load-time. \r\n\r\n3. Product Discovery \r\nAccording to research conducted by Klevu, there are usability and accessibility issues with the search experience on 80% of UK ecommerce websites. A lot of businesses are losing revenue due to poor product discovery.  \r\n\r\nIf users can’t find the product they are looking for; they are not going to purchase it. It’s as simple as that. The products and content on your website should be easily discoverable for a good overall user experience design. \r\n\r\n4. Load Time\r\nNothing is more annoying than a website that takes a lot of time to load. In fact, slow page load time is one of the main reasons for visitors to abandon a website. Your website should take 4-5 seconds to load, at most.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, load time can also affect your search engine rankings. A specific algorithm is used by Google to determine the ranking of a website, and the page load speed is one of the factors analyzed. \r\n\r\nTherefore, you might want to put  in all the effort it takes into reducing the load time of your website.', ''),

(11, 'Benefits of automation in healthcare industry', '2022-06-28 15:03:29', 'The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted some nations so adversely that their healthcare systems have reached the point of exhaustion. In fact, the pandemic has been an eye-opener, forcing leaders and healthcare providers to focus on the dire need for automation in the healthcare sector to lessen the burden on the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nAutomation is the future of healthcare, without it, the whole system is bound to crumble. Today, we are going to be talking about the benefits of automation in the healthcare industry, and why we heavily rely on it nowadays. Read down below to find out all about it.\r\n\r\nWhat benefits does automation provide for healthcare services?\r\nAccording to Deloitte, in 2021, the health tech industry is expected to hit $280 billion with a CAGR of 15.9% between 2016-2021. Curious to know how technology helps healthcare services? Let’s see.\r\n\r\n1. Quicker data retrieval \r\nData retrieval holds critical importance in the medical world. Retrieval and analysis of data allow doctors and physicians instant access to the electronic health records of patients. The different functions of data retrieval and analysis directly impact different aspects of health care including billing procedures and medical diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThough data retrieval used to be a time-consuming task a few years back, electronic health record (EHR) machines now allow real-time data retrieval effectively, within minutes. This has not only helped make the whole data extraction process easier but has also improved patient care. \r\n\r\n2. Improved ordering\r\nManual ordering process can take a lot of time and effort. Thanks to the EHR machine, it is possible to complete orders only with a few clicks. It is expected that the efficiency in the ordering process will increase further in the coming years with the help of predictive artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.\r\n\r\n3. Faster billing\r\nBilling in healthcare used to be another hectic task before the advent of smart machines. But now, healthcare institutions can quickly generate bills through AI machines. This reduces the wait time for patients, improves patient care, and increases customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHow does healthcare automation help patients?\r\nThe global EHR/EMR market is expected to reach $38 billion by 2025. Automation provides countless benefits for patients. Some of them include:\r\n\r\n1. Early disease detection\r\nThere are hundreds of benefits of early disease detection in patients. Not only does it allow doctors and physicians to get started with the treatment early, but it can also be a life-saver most of the time. Thanks to technologies like AI and machine learning, it is now possible to diagnose illnesses and diseases within days and even minutes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, advanced technology can even detect whether a patient is affected by a particular disease even before its symptoms appear. For example, early-stage lung cancer can be detected through neural networks. The earlier the disease is detected, the quicker it can get treated, and catching cancer at its first stage can significantly increase a patient’s survival rate as compared to diagnosing in its last stages.\r\n\r\n2. Precision and speed in medical diagnosis\r\nTime is a critical aspect when it comes to healthcare. If a disease is not diagnosed on time, there are more chances that it becomes fatal quickly. However, a speedy diagnosis can  save a patient’s life. At times, medical practitioners can make serious mistakes and blunders trying to diagnose a patient’s illness. On the other hand, the chances of errors are dramatically reduced with automated systems in healthcare.\r\n\r\nOther than this, through healthcare automation solutions, it is also possible to detect patient deviation from prescribed health plans, allowing doctors to take care of the situation in real-time. Also, automation has helped make it easier and more convenient for patients to buy drugs from automated dispensing machines in hospitals, rather than having to wait in long queues.\r\n\r\n4. Improved patient management and participation\r\nTele health and telemedicine mobile apps have made it much easier for patients to get quality healthcare and medical attention on time. In fact, mobile apps have even made it possible for people living in remote locations to get the medical care they need without having to visit the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of mobile apps in the healthcare industry include faster access to healthcare, better communication and collaboration between patients and doctors, improved medication adherence, an easier appointment booking process, and much more.\r\n\r\n5. Minimal errors\r\nEven the slightest possible error in health care provision can result in a huge problem later on. At times, doctors and physicians tend to make errors due to inattentiveness and fatigue. However, automated machines don’t suffer from the weakness that humans do, and hence the chances of errors are also very less. This means precise results, quicker diagnosis, and improved quality of healthcare.\r\n\r\n6. Improved healthcare quality\r\nThe biggest all-encompassing benefit of robotic process automation in the medical industry is that it promotes superior quality healthcare. Through quicker diagnosis, reduced error occurrences, and more time for healthcare providers to focus on patient-centric activities, the effectiveness of healthcare has more than doubled over the past few years.\r\n\r\nMoreover, since a lot of processes in healthcare have been automated, the excessive burden on healthcare providers reduced dramatically, allowing them to pay attention to more patients simultaneously.\r\n\r\n7. Better communication \r\nAccording to Jackson healthcare, 64% Americans prefer to communicate with their doctors via video tele health.\r\n\r\nEnhanced communication is another major benefit that automation in healthcare has provided. It is now possible for doctors and patients to stay in contact with one another 24/7 without having to visit the hospital every day. \r\n\r\nMoreover, with the help of daily reminders and notifications, the number of missed appointments and meetings have also reduced for patients. Appointment booking, cancellations, and rescheduling can also be done much quicker and conveniently. This helps streamline the whole system and allows patients to get care at the right time.', ''),
(12, 'How to Effectively Market Your Healthcare Software Online?', '2022-06-28 15:05:16', 'Business promotion through social media is one of the best ways of increasing brand awareness and we have many examples to back this up. The same can be applied to healthcare software promotion. Today we’ll learn how marketing healthcare software can be beneficial for business growth and enhance your digital presence.\r\n\r\nHow Social Media Enhances Healthcare Software Marketing?\r\nhealthcare-software-marketing-facebook\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe days of word-of-mouth referral systems have become old, obsolete, and inefficient when it comes to marketing. In this digital age, most companies are going for personalized software. This is why custom software development for the healthcare sector has become quite investible.\r\n\r\nThis option becomes increasingly beneficial when you realize that social media not only assists healthcare software marketing efforts but also helps you set up an environment for your customers to converge to. The type of social media campaign that you will set up for your business after the healthcare software development process is complete, will ensure the type of response you will get from your audience. \r\n\r\nChoosing software for your healthcare business is just the first part of your business progression. Crucial healthcare software marketing aspects such as website review score, app reviews, user-friendliness, and customer interaction will define how users perceive your software.\r\n\r\nAlso Read: Benefits of automation in healthcare industry\r\n\r\nHow to Strengthen my Healthcare Software’s Online presence?\r\nSocial media marketing is all about consistency. The marketing strategies must include frequent content postings, so the algorithms and the visitors know that your business is active. Now, a well-developed healthcare software can sell itself but in reality, it is just a product. The face of your business are your website and social media handles. The marketing strategy will define your business and the healthcare software development company’s online perception.\r\n\r\nHere’s how to sell healthcare software?\r\n1)  Choose Suitable Platforms for your Healthcare Software Marketing Efforts\r\nHealthcare businesses must understand that not every social media platform is suitable for businesses. Although there are some trending apps like TikTok or Snapchat for business promotion but not everyone can benefit from them. \r\n\r\nMoreover, when it comes to healthcare software marketing, you should largely focus on platforms that can effectively promote your business online. Social media apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn are more apt for healthcare-related marketing strategies.\r\n\r\n2)   Study the Competitors Thoroughly\r\nEven in the medical business, it is best practice to keep an eye on your competitors marketing initiatives. Before you build your social media marketing strategy, analyze how your competition is doing it. Try to figure out what strategies are working for them and which ones are causing their Binge Google search engine rankings to fall.\r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly studying your competitor’s strategy to increase awareness for their healthcare software, you will also be able to devise a comprehensive campaign that best fits your company’s requirements, goals, and objectives.\r\n\r\nUseful tips: take note of their popular posts, content that makes their page different, and how they are interacting with visitors. Also, try to see whether they are doing extra activities like holding webinars on LinkedIn or online conferences related to specific topics. All of this contributes to how they attract visitors to their page, eventually leading them to their website or software.\r\n\r\n3)   Create Engaging Content for your Healthcare Software Marketing Campaigns\r\nWhenever you visit a page on Facebook, there is a high tendency that you are judging the page/company by the type of content it is displaying. Low-quality images and written content that hardly contain any information are exactly what you have to avoid. Since the main objective of these healthcare software marketing efforts, you will have to create plenty of informational content. \r\n\r\nTalk about how your software product can do better, pull up infographics, and even hold polls to increase audience interaction. Try ‘Did You Know?’ posts as well!\r\n\r\nRead More: SQUID GAME & MARKETING: A PERFECT DUO\r\n\r\n4)   Don’t Be Afraid Of Reviews!\r\nWhether you are the owner of an on-demand healthcare mobile app, or a custom healthcare software development company, one thing is evident: you need to be in the good books when it comes to online ratings & reviews. It is great customer service if you provide your clients with a chance to drop reviews. Let them talk about what they think about your healthcare software or your business. \r\n\r\nRemember: Even negative reviews & comments are an opportunity for improvement. Reviews only work best if you constantly go through them and see what customers are saying about you.\r\n\r\nUltimately, you are setting up a base of confidence for your new visitors and customers who are looking for medical services. Bad reviews would not scare them away if they also know how you have improved. This will tell them how you are constantly working to improve your services.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nIf you are doing your online marketing the right way, chances are that your healthcare web and mobile app development efforts will not go in vain. \r\n\r\nIt is always good to remember that while developers may provide a great UI/UX design, how you market your product afterward will be the deciding factor. Whether it is a mobile app or website, make sure you choose a platform that aligns exactly with your company goals and marketing objectives. ', '');
